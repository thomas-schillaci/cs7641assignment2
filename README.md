My code is available on github at:

https://github.com/thomas-schillaci/cs7641assignment2

In order for it to work, you should use Andrew Rollings and Genevieve Hayes' fork of mlrose using:

pip install -e git+git://github.com/hiive/mlrose#egg=mlrose-hiive

My code was developped on a python3.7 environment but should work with python3.6.

My repository contains a pyhon package Assignment2 with two files:

	- optimization_problems.py which tackles the first part
	- neural_networks.py which deals with the second part

Launching the files is enough for my whole analysis to be computed, but it takes quite a long time (with a good cpu and a decent gpu). The running time of each call is indicated at the end of each file.
